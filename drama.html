    <h1>Pursuit Of Happines</h1>
    <h2>Birth : 2006</h2>
    <p><b>The Pursuit of Happyness </b>is a <u> 2006 American biographical drama film </u>
        directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring <br>Will Smith as
         Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden 
         Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's <br> son,
        Christopher Jr. The screenplay by <b>Steven Conrad</b> is
        based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name
        written by Gardner <br>with Quincy Troupe. It is based on
         Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2]
        The unusual spelling of the film's title comes <br>from a
        mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the
         daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in <u>San Francisco in 1981</u>.</p>
