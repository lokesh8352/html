        <h1>1945</h1>
        <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="html">an article </a>in <a href="html">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical
        device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
        <h1>1960s</h1>
        <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, 
        email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See <a href="html"> Bootstrap Institute library</a>.</p>
        <p>Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.
        20th National Conference, New York, <a href="html">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to 
        "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.</p>
        <p>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
        <h1>1980</h1>
        <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything",
         which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links.
          "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="html">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or as <a href="html">HTML page(alt).</a>
